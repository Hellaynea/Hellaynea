- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hellaynea
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as I am trying to reach a new horizon in my career. Even if I am 34 years old, I think that if you have the willingness to do it you can make it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to record all my journey with all the steps that I can. Fell free to give me any tips if you want!!
